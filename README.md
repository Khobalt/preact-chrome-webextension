# Bookmark Manager

![Bookmark Manager](/screenshot.png)

Bookmark manager created in [preact](https://preactjs.com/) with [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/),  
mostly leveraging the [table component](https://material-ui.com/components/tables/). Preact is used   
to keep the bundle size down, however in the context  
of a web-extension, this can introduve quite a few  
challenges to development.  

## How to run with it:

1. Clone/fork this repo
2. Hit the terminal:
```shell
yarn
yarn start     #Rapid development with watched folder
yarn build     #Deploy to './build' directory

```
3. At this point take eveything in the build folder and [follow these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/)
